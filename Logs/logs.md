## Class 2 — [Date]

*What we did:*
- Created **README.md** — set up the course repo with title "OIM3690 - Web Development," an About Me section (Viraj Shah), course info (time 11:30 AM–1:00 PM, Gerber 103), and a Links section with my portfolio/GitHub link.
- Created **logs.md** — this class log file to record what we do each session.

*What I learnt:*
- How to structure a GitHub repo for a web development course (README as the main landing page, clear sections for course info and links).
- Using Markdown for documentation (headers, lists, links) and keeping a running log of class work.

*Notes:* Set up the GitHub repo structure and started logging. Ready to build the actual course page next.

## Class 3 — [Date]

*What we did:*
- **Redesigned the course page layout** — rebuilt the main page with a top navigation bar, hero header, profile card, assignments/projects sections, weekly log area, resources section, and footer. Added a dark mode toggle so the page can switch between light and dark themes.
- **Studied babson.edu for inspiration** — inspected the Babson College homepage to understand its structure, layout, and navigation patterns, and applied similar ideas (sections, nav, hero) to our course page.
- **Created an images folder** and added my profile photo; replaced the "VS" placeholder in the profile card with the actual picture so the page feels personal and complete.
- **Saved babson.edu HTML for class exercise** — created **babson.html** by fetching the full HTML source of babson.edu so I can use it offline for exercises (e.g. inspecting markup, structure, and tags).
- **Ran the site locally** (Python HTTP server on port 8080) to preview changes in the browser. Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub.

*What I learnt:*
- How to plan a multi-section page layout (nav, hero, cards, footer) and implement it in HTML/CSS.
- Using real sites (like babson.edu) as reference for structure and UX, and how to capture a page’s HTML for offline analysis.
- Organising assets (images folder, profile photo) and wiring them into the page.
- Using a local server to test the site and the workflow of commit → push to keep the repo up to date.

*Notes:* The page feels like a real course site now. Next: fill in weekly log and assignment details as we go, and use babson.html for markup/structure exercises.
